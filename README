Some utilities for working on a hpc cluster

1) macopen
   - This script scps a bunch of files to you mac and then
     opens them up, using the mac open command. If you're
     using a complicated tunnel setup such that the ip listen
     in your SSH_CLIENT env variable isn't the machine on which
     you want to open your files, you can set set your localhost
     string in the lib/config/macopen.yaml file.

2) ccat
   - This is a replacement for the cat command that uses pygmentize
     to display the output in color with automatically detected syntax
     highlighting (for code)

3) pwnq
   - Saturate a pbs scheduler with submissions. Many pbs schedulers
     will only let you submit a certain number of jobs at a time. This
     program will continuously submit jobs, check the status of the queue,
     and when one of your jobs finishes it will submit the next one.

   - Note that the names of your queues and their capacities are set in
     the config file found at lib/config/pwnq.yaml. The queues are all
     assumed to be all from the same filesystem, but have seperate capacities
